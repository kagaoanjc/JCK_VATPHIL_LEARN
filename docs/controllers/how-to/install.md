# Sector Files

The Philippines vACC utilizes EuroScope for its Air Traffic Controllers as it can host a near 1 to 1 system that the real world controllers use (TopSky).

Currently, only approved controllers may use our sector files.

# Installing Sector Files

## VATPHIL Updater

The VATPHIL Updater is a desktop application that automatically downloads, installs, and keeps your sector files up to date. It handles everything from first-time installation to AIRAC cycle updates.

### Logging In

When you open the updater, you will be prompted to log in with your VATSIM account.

1. Click **Login with VATSIM** — your browser will open the VATSIM SSO page.
2. Approve the login in your browser.
3. The app will detect the login automatically and bring you to the main screen.

!!! note
    Only controllers authorised by the Philippines vACC staff will be granted access. If you see a "CID not authorised" error and are a active controller, please contact us.

### Selecting an Installation Folder

Before installing, you need to point the updater to a folder where your sector files will live.

2. Navigate to any location on your computer (e.g. your EuroScope directory).
3. The updater will automatically create a **VATPHIL Sector** subfolder inside your chosen location.

??? tip
    The updater remembers your folder between sessions — you only need to do this once.

### Keeping the Updater Itself Up to Date
